# A2SNN
A project comparing ANNs and SNNs on the same tasks in different metrics such as perfomance, accuracy, method. Two similar frameworks are used for this purpose: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [SNNTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/).

## Disclaimer
To get real perfomance in power saving or speed we should run examples on [Neuromorphic hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03717). Moreover it is incorrect to speak about performance in looking on raw results of comparing. ANNs and SNNs are good for different tasks. So this project does not claim to be scientific discoveries.

## Installation
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you can run notebooks on your local machine for evaluation

## Results
Every result is presented on its sub page. Further overall conclusion will be here
